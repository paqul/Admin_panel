# Admin_panel
Repository with code to admin_panel using django framework

1. Please Download and unpack,
2. Open project: "project_django" (for example in PyCharm),
3. Configure the interpreter and attach the missing packages using "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the console,
4. Check migrations and applications ("manage.py migrate", and "manage.py makemigrations" in console)
4. Use "manage.py runserver" to start website (all informations to log in to Admin Panel will be in MainPage).
5. That is all what I made using django framework.
